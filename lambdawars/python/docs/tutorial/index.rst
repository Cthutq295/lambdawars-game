  The Lambda Wars Python Tutorial
######################

:Release: |version|
:Date: |today|

One of the main new features of the 1.0 and later releases is Python support. 
Almost all game related code is now written in Python, replacing the old  
`keyvalues <http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Keyvalues>`_
script system. This includes units, abilities, game modes, weapons and the HUD. The usage 
of Python has several advantages. For example the code is typeless and the code 
can be reloaded on the fly.

So what is Python? *Python is an interpreted, general-purpose high-level programming 
language[4] whose design philosophy emphasizes code readability. Python aims to combine 
"remarkable power with very clear syntax", and its standard library is large and 
comprehensive. Its use of indentation for block delimiters is unusual among popular 
programming languages* (Wikipedia).

You can find a beginners guide at the Python website (see http://docs.python.org/tutorial/).

This tutorial aims to highlight the main features of Python in Lambda Wars.

Now head over to the introduction!
