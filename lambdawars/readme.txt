Lambda Wars

==============================================================
Lambda Wars is a free modification based on Valve Software's 
Half-Life 2, and runs on the Source engine. 
The basic premise of Lambda Wars is to create an original RTS 
in the Half-Life 2 setting, adding new ideas of our own while 
staying within the relative boundaries of the HL2 universe's 
established canon.
